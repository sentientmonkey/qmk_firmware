# Keymaps

Default keymaps for the macropad1x5. The via keymaps work with [Via](https://caniusevia.com/) and [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) (tested with version 0.4). For use with Via the via.json needs to be loaded manually as a draft definition in the Design tab, while Vial reads the layout from the MCU. At this point the encoder is not supported in Via, the use of Vial is therefore recommended.
